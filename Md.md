### init

Use the crap-top

Check batteries, use a voltmeter to controlle the batteri charges, the batteries are fully charged if the voltage is 16.8v (see wiki page about batteries).

## Connect to beluga

There is aliases for connecting to the varius computing node of beluga. Use bachrc or aliases to list the different aliases.

```bash
$ cat ./bachrc
```
or
```bash
$ alias
```

beluga ip addresses
- rasberrypi = 
- xavior = 

The alias "rpi" connects you to the rasberrypi and alias "xavier" connects you to the xavier, both on beluga.
