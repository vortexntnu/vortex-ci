## start / init

Check the voltage of the batteries.
  - Batteris should be at 16+ V (prob not 17V)
  - You need two batteries, both should be at the same voltage (+- 0.1v)

Charge batteries with mode "balacing mode", four battery celles and 3.0A.

Vacume seal el-huset (the tube containing the electronincs) and the battary module (tube containg the batteries). Start by using the electric vacume pump. There is a blue and red seal, blue should be connected to beluga while red to the vacume pump (they ensure a good air seal, mening when you decouple dem the air does not leak back into the modules). The air presure should be close to -15 psi, the electric vacume pump is not accurate enough (use it close to a green line), thus you should get an aproximet with the electric pump and use the hand pump to get the accurate pressure. Leave the hand pump attached for 10min and observe the reading, if after 10min the pressure has changed their is a leak in the module.

How to use the electric vacume pump, ensure all connections are tight. Blue ventil should be open (and connected to the module) while red ventil should be closed. If you can hear airflow something is not tight.
