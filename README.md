# vortex-ci
Github actions / workflows, vortex config and setup files.

## Goal
As we continue to develop more and more workflows, some workflows might already exist in some repo or a workflow is needed in several repos. The goal with this repository is to create a bot to manage all workflows, you state what workflow you need in the config.yaml file and the bot copies that workflow from the workflows folder to your repository.

## Workflows
Supported workflows are documented [here](./.github/workflows/README.md)

### How to add a workflow to a repo
1. In the chosen repo, click the `Actions` tab
2. Click `New workflow`
3. Ask DevOps for help
