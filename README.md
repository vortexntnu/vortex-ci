# GitHub - IaC
Github manager, control github actions and workflows of vortex repositories

```yaml
Responsible:    Vortex - DevOps
Contact:        fabiako@ntnu.no
Working:        YESNT 
```

## Goal
As we continue to develop more and more workflows, some workflows might already exsist in some repo or a workflow is needed in several repos. The goal with this repository is to create a bot to manage all workflows, you state what workflow you need in the config.yaml file and the bot copies that workflow from the workflows folder to your repository.

## Config
info on the config.yaml file, with exsamples, not implemented yet

## Workflows
Supported workflows are documented [here](./.github/workflows/README.md)

### How to add a workflow to a repo
1. In the chosen repo, click the `Actions` tab
2. Click `New workflow`
3. Ask DevOps for help

## Bot
info on how the bot works, not yet implemented
