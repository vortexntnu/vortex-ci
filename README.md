# vortex-ci
This repository holds reusable workflows for CI.
Supported workflows are documented [here](/.github/workflows/README.md)!

## Goal
Our goal is to centralize and simplify the management of CI/CD workflows. By keeping all reusable workflows in one central repository, we ensure consistency across projects and reduce maintenance overhead.

### How to add a workflow to a repo
1. In the chosen repo, click the `Actions` tab
2. Click `New workflow`
3. Ask DevOps for help
