# vortex-ci
This repository holds reusable workflows for CI.
Supported workflows are documented [here](/.github/workflows/README.md)!

## Goal
Our goal is to centralize and simplify the management of CI/CD workflows. By keeping all reusable workflows in one central repository, we ensure consistency across projects and reduce maintenance overhead.

### How to add a workflow to a repo
1. Open the `.github/workflows` directory in your repository.
2. Pick a template from the [here](/.github/workflows/README.md)
3. Copy the template into your repositories `.github/workflows` directory.
4. Modify the template to fit your project.
5. Commit and push the changes to your repository.
